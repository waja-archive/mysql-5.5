 This previously copyrighted work has been placed into the  public     
 domain	by  the  author  and  may be freely used for any purpose,     
 private or commercial.						      
 .
 Because of the number of inquiries I was receiving about the  use     
 of this product in commercially developed works I have decided to     
 simply make it public domain to further its unrestricted use.	I     
 specifically  would  be  most happy to see this material become a     
 part of the standard Unix distributions by AT&T and the  Berkeley     
 Computer  Science  Research Group, and a standard part of the GNU     
 system from the Free Software Foundation.			      
 .
 I would appreciate it, as a courtesy, if this notice is  left  in     
 all copies and derivative works.  Thank you.			      
 .
 The author makes no warranty of any kind  with	respect  to  this     
 product  and  explicitly disclaims any implied warranties of mer-     
 chantability or fitness for any particular purpose.
